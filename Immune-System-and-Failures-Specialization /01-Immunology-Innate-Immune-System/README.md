## 📚 Course Overview  

This course provides an in-depth exploration of the **innate immune system**, which serves as the body’s **first, fast, and inherited line of defense** against infections.  
It examines the **mechanisms and cellular components** that operate within minutes of exposure to a pathogen, offering an essential understanding of the early immune response.  

Learners gain insight into how the innate immune system **recognizes and combats infection**, **communicates with the adaptive immune system**, and how **environmental factors such as the microbiome** influence immunity.  
The course also encourages reflection on **current issues and debates** in innate immunity research.

## 🎯 Relevance to My Field

As a **Master’s student in Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics**, this course strengthened my understanding of **innate immune defense mechanisms**, a core foundation for both **immunology** and **cancer biology**.

Building on my undergraduate project on **autoimmune diseases**, it provided insights into:

* **Innate immune components and barriers**
* **Complement system activation and pathogen clearance**
* **Microbiota’s role in immune programming**
* **Antigen processing via MHC I & II**
* **Natural Killer cell functions and regulation**

This knowledge helps me connect **innate immune signaling** to **tumor microenvironment interactions** and supports the integration of **bioinformatics analyses with experimental cancer research**.
