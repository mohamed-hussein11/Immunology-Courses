## 📚 Course Overview  

This course explores the **mechanisms and immune responses** involved in autoimmune diseases and hyper-responsive immune conditions such as **asthma**, focusing on the consequences of an **overactive immune system**.  
It examines the **causes, risk factors, immune dysregulation, and pathological outcomes** underlying autoimmunity, allergies, and transplant rejection.

Learners analyze how disrupted immune regulation leads to:  
- **Self-aggression and autoimmune disease**  
- **Haematological autoimmune disorders**  
- **Asthma and allergic hypersensitivity reactions**  
- **Antibody-mediated graft rejection**  

The course combines mechanistic understanding with clinical relevance and modern treatment strategies.

## 🎯 Relevance to My Field  

As a **Master’s student in Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics**, and building on my undergraduate graduation project on **autoimmune diseases**, this course provided a structured and clinically relevant understanding of **immune dysregulation** and the consequences of inadequate immune control.

The modules offered clear insights directly aligned with both my previous academic background and current research direction. Through the detailed discussions on **autoimmunity**, **SLE**, **haematological autoimmune disorders**, **allergic hyper-responsiveness**, and **antibody-mediated transplant rejection**, the course strengthened my ability to:

* Understand how **immune tolerance mechanisms fail**, leading to auto-aggressive responses
* Connect **dysregulated immune signaling** to chronic inflammatory diseases
* Analyze how **environmental and genetic factors** contribute to hyper-responsive conditions such as asthma
* Examine **immune-mediated destruction of blood components**, which is relevant to both immunopathology and cancer-related hematological alterations
* Study **innate and adaptive immune involvement in graft rejection**, a key model for understanding overactive immune activation

These concepts enhance my foundation in **molecular immunology**, allowing me to better interpret how disrupted immune pathways contribute to disease, including **autoimmune disorders and cancer immune escape**.
The course also supports my bioinformatics perspective by providing mechanistic details that can be integrated with computational analyses of immune-related datasets.
