## 📚 Course Overview  

This course examines the **failures of the human immune system**, including **immunodeficiencies, chronic inflammation, and immune dysregulation in cancer**.  
Learners explore the mechanisms leading to insufficient or overactive immune responses and their consequences for **disease susceptibility, tissue damage, and tumour development**.  

The course also addresses **tertiary lymphoid structures**, **tumour-immune interactions**, and the role of **viral infections in human cancer**, providing a comprehensive view of immune system dysfunction and therapeutic strategies.

## 🎯 Relevance to My Field  

As a **Master’s student in Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics**, this course deepened my understanding of **immune failures and tumour-immune interactions**, which are central to both **cancer immunology** and **therapeutic strategy design**.

The course directly supports my academic and research interests by providing insights into:

- Mechanisms of **primary and secondary immunodeficiencies**  
- Formation and function of **tertiary lymphoid structures** in chronic inflammation  
- **Tumour microenvironment interactions** and immune evasion  
- Role of **viral persistence** in cancer development  
- Translational approaches using **immune-based therapies**  

This knowledge strengthens my ability to link **bioinformatics analyses** to **immune regulation in cancer** and improves my foundation for **experimental and computational research in tumour immunology**.
