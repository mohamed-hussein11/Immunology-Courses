## 📚 Course Overview  

This course explores the constant **interplay between pathogens and the human immune system**, highlighting the mechanisms of defense and the strategies pathogens use to evade immunity.  
It examines **bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and prions**, their interactions with host immunity, and the consequences of immune evasion, including disease development.

Learners gain knowledge on how **molecular and cellular immune responses** protect the host, and how pathogens exploit **immune evasion strategies**, sometimes resulting in severe infections.

## 🎯 Relevance to My Field  

As a **Master’s student in Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics**, this course expanded my understanding of **host-pathogen interactions**, which is crucial for analyzing **immune dysregulation in infectious diseases and cancer-related immune responses**.

Building on my research on **autoimmune diseases**, the course provided insights into:

- Innate and adaptive mechanisms of defense against **extracellular and intracellular bacteria**  
- Cellular and molecular strategies in **viral immunity and evasion**, including SARS-CoV-2  
- Immune mechanisms against **fungal and parasitic infections**  
- Challenges in immune recognition and pathogen evasion in **malaria and leishmaniasis**  
- Immunopathology and **host response diversity in tuberculosis**  

This knowledge enhances my ability to **integrate bioinformatics analyses with immunological and molecular data**, bridging host-pathogen interactions with cancer biology.
