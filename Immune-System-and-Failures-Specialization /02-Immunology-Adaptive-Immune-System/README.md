## 📚 Course Overview  

This course provides a comprehensive exploration of the **adaptive (acquired) immune system**, which develops **specialized immunity** against pathogens following initial exposure.  
Learners are guided through the **lymphocyte subsets**, including **B and T cells**, their **development, differentiation, and effector functions**, and the **mechanisms that ensure self-tolerance**.  

Key aspects include:

- How **adaptive immunity** complements the innate immune response  
- Mechanisms that **distinguish self from non-self antigens**  
- The **impact of aging** on immune responses  
- Insights into **therapeutic applications and immune regulation**  

This course prepares students to understand **immune responses in infection, autoimmunity, and cancer**, providing a foundation for integrating **experimental and computational approaches** in research.

## 🧠 Modules  

| Module | Title | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | B Cell Effector Functions and Tolerance | Explore B lymphocyte development, lineage commitment, effector mechanisms, and tolerance to self-antigens. |
| 2 | T Cell Activation, T Helper Subsets and Receptors | Examine T cell development, differentiation into helper subtypes, T cell receptor diversity, and mechanisms preventing autoreactivity. |
| 3 | Cytotoxic Killing | Learn how cytotoxic T lymphocytes directly eliminate infected and tumor cells, and how their activity is tightly regulated. |
| 4 | Regulatory T Cells | Understand the development and function of Tregs, their role in regulating immune responses, and therapeutic implications. |
| 5 | Lymphocyte Recirculation and Homing | Study how lymphocytes migrate to infection or activation sites, including diapedesis and tissue-specific homing mechanisms. |
| 6 | The Effect of Age on the Function of the Immune System | Explore the impact of aging on adaptive immunity, the concept of inflammaging, and implications for health and therapy. |

## 🎯 Relevance to My Field

As a **Master’s student in Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics**, this course strengthened my understanding of **adaptive immune mechanisms**, which are critical for:  

- **B and T lymphocyte biology** and their role in pathogen clearance  
- **Immune tolerance** and mechanisms preventing autoimmunity  
- **Cytotoxic and regulatory mechanisms** relevant to tumor surveillance  
- **Lymphocyte trafficking** in the tumor microenvironment  
- **Aging and immune regulation**, impacting therapeutic strategies  

By connecting these insights with **bioinformatics analyses**, I can explore **immune system interactions with cancer**, predict immune evasion, and design integrative research approaches.
