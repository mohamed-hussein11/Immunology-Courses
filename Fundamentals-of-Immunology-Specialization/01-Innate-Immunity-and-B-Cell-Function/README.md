## 📚 Course Overview  

This course introduces students to the **basic functions of the adaptive and innate immune systems**, providing the vocabulary and concepts necessary to interact with the medical community.  

The course covers:

- **Cells, tissues, and organs** of the immune system using metaphors, cartoons, and models  
- **Structure, function, and varieties of antibodies**  
- Mechanisms of **antibody variation, gene rearrangement, class switching, and affinity maturation**  
- Anatomical context of immune system organization  
- Testing with multiple-choice questions referencing diagrams, drawings, and photographs  

Learners gain insights into **how adaptive and innate immune systems protect the body**, antibody structures, B-cell function, and the coding and expression of these structures in DNA.
